Binary tree
Inorder: Left, node, right; yields sorted values for BSTs.
Preorder: Node, left, right; useful for tree copying.
Postorder: Left, right, node; used for tree deletion and evaluation

The Map Object: 
Holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

Map VS {}
Use {} (objects) when you have string keys, need simplicity, and care about performance for small datasets.
Use Map when you need non-string keys, guaranteed insertion order, or efficient management of dynamic key-value pairs with built-in methods.


Character Frequency Count	O(n)	O(1)	Faster, constant space, scalable	Limited to small fixed alphabet (e.g., 26 letters)
Sorting Approach	O(n log n)	O(n)	Simple, works for any characters	Slower, uses more space for sorting
