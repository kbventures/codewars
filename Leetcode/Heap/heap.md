Implement a Max-Heap — flip comparisons from min-heap.

Implement a Priority Queue — wrap your heap with enqueue/dequeue methods.

Merge k Sorted Lists — classic heap usage to merge efficiently.

Top K Frequent Elements — use heap to find most frequent items.

Kth Largest Element in Array — maintain a min-heap of size k.

Heap Sort — use heap to sort an array in-place.

LeetCode challenges almost never expect you to check for unbalanced heaps in array form, but if the heap is represented as a binary tree, you might be expected to:

Validate heap property in a binary tree (isHeap).

Check if a binary tree is complete, e.g., "Check if Binary Tree is Heap".

Convert tree to heap, needing structure checks.
