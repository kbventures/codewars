A prime integer (or simply a prime number) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number can only be divided by 1 and the number itself without leaving a remainder.

Key Characteristics of Prime Numbers:
Greater than 1: Prime numbers must be greater than 1.
No divisors other than 1 and itself: A prime number cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers besides 1 and itself.
Examples:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
Examples:
2 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 2.
3 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 3.
4 is not a prime number because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, and 4.
Important Notes:
2 is the smallest prime number and is also the only even prime number. All other even numbers are divisible by 2, so they can't be prime.
Prime numbers are important in number theory and play a key role in cryptography, such as in RSA encryption.
