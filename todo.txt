Good afternoon, friends.

Our esteemed Project Manager is moving on to new challenges—thank you for bringing us so close to the finish line.

The designs for the public-facing application pages have been implemented.

Our back end now supports the necessary features for both the public-facing and private beta functionalities.

During this transition, I’ll take on the role of Project Coordinator and continue leading the development team.

The foundations you've built—both design and code—are impressive. We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished under Marco’s awesome leadership.

To stay aligned with the organization's needs, I’ll be meeting with Dann, our direct, and possibly Marco.

In the coming weeks, Dann and I would like to meet with the Design team to align objectives.

In the meantime, we’re all professionals who’ve brought us this far, and we’re confident in your continued contributions.

Development team (those not on vacation or job searching):
Please continue connecting the implemented pages, testing the sign-up/sign-in flow, creating issues for any bugs, and resolving existing GitHub issues.

Design team:
Once integration and testing are complete, we’ll be ready to implement key features: Profile and Team Cards, Multi-Profile and Team Pages, and editing features for both. We’ll also build the public versions of the profile and team pages.

Goal: A working app with all the above by September 23rd. Go team!
