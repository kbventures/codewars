//Return the number of unique arrays that can be formed by picking exactly one element from each subarray.

//For example: solve([[1,2],[4],[5,6]]) = 4, because it results in only 4 possibilites. They are [1,4,5],[1,4,6],[2,4,5],[2,4,6].

//Make sure that you don't count duplicates; for example solve([[1,2],[4,4],[5,6,6]]) = 4, since the extra outcomes are just duplicates.
